# Dylan Cole Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio. My motivation for creating this portfolio was to have a place to showcase my best work as a developer. After browsing other portfolios on the internet for inspiration, I decided to go with a simple, yet functional design that would allow me to practice everything that I have learned so for about HTML and CSS. Through this project, I have solidified my understanding of these programming languages.
